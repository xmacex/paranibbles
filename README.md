# Paranibbles

Paranibbles for paradiddles.

A four step binary pattern is run, then inverted, and run again. That is eight steps. Default 3 in binary `0100 1011`.

Set where to send and what to send in params.

At this stage does not send MIDI off messages, so stuck notes to be expected. Use percussion sounds such as one-off drum samples.

Gl√ºck auf!
