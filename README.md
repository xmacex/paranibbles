# Paranibbles

Paranibbles for paradiddles.

![](paradiddles.gif)

Paradiddles are drumming patterns, e.g. `RLRR LRLL`. Nibbles are half a byte, 4 bits. With *paranibbles* you set the first four bits as a number, and the script extends this to a full byte.

A small personal script for exploring paradiddles. Maybe you too will enjoy it. Expect bugs and stuck notes.

## Requirements

- norns
- MIDI device, or n.b.

### Documentation

- encoder 2: set the first nibble
- encoder 3: rotate accent pattern

Set where to send and what to send in params.
